> Warning: Do not deploy this to production without putting together more of a real front-end!
> The browser code checked in currently is just a stub--  it just grabs a string from the URL
> and trusts that as your username, sending it to the backend and injecting it directly into
> the DOM.  If you were to put it online as-is, this would leave your users open to XSS attacks!
